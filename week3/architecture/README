How to Play

---Game Creation---

To begin a game, run 'php main.php portnumber'. This will create a socket for communication to and from
the server at port 'portnumber'

---Playing the Game---

Every turn the player will be sent a long string (s) containing the state of the game. It will include:

s[0] - A flag to let the player know if they are in a stage to add weights to the board or remove 
weights from the board: 1 = adding weights, 2 = removing weights.

s[1:51] - The weights at each position on the board. 0 if the space is unoccupied and a weight can be
placed there.

s[52] - A flag to let the player know if the game has ended or not. 0 = The game is still going and the
player must make a move, 1 = The game has ended.

To make a move, the player must send a string to the server containing the following depending on the stage
of the game:

---Adding Weights

If the player is still adding weights (i.e. has weights left to add), he must send the following to the server:
'x y', where x is the weight in kg of the weight you'd like to add, and y is the position where you'd like to add
it [-25, 25]. These numbers must be delimited by a single space.

---Removing Weights

If the player is removing weights, he must send a string containing the following:
'x' where x is the position of the weight to be removed in his turn.

---Illegal Moves---

Making an illegal move will result in the player immediately losing the game. This includes:

-Placing the same weight twice
-Placing a weight on an occupied space
-Attempting to place a weight in a space not represented on the board (ie. x > 25 || x < -25)
-Attempting to remove a weight from an unoccupied space

---Random test client---
test.py is included to test your algorithm against. If running on energon2, be sure to ensure you're running
Python 2.7. (If not, load it with 'module load python-2.7')

To run the test script, use the same port number that using to call the php script. For example, using our test.py
you should use this command 'python test.py portnumber', which portnumber is the same number given to the php script.
Therefor your code should also accept port number as an argument.
