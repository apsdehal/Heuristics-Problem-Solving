Problem can be represented as a graph G = (V, E), where V are the number of the vertices and E are edges between them which represent the distance weight. Distance weight is calculated by Manhattan Distance. Each node V has following properties associated with it:

- Opening Hour
- Closing hour
- Value associated with it
- Desired time to spent
- X coordinate
- Y coordinate

Paths will be stored in a vector of vectors which will have size M i.e. the number of days available.

In the end, we will print out this vector according to the problem description
