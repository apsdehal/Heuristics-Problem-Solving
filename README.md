# Heuristics Problem Solving

This repository contains our solutions to problems provided by Dr Dennis Shasha during Heuristics Problem Solving class at NYU Fall 2016.

More details are listed inside each folder's readme (problem description and solution approach). Most of the problems are NP-Complete in nature and we have to apply suitable heuristics to solve these under the time limit of 2 minutes and provide an efficient solution. Solutions of teams (12 in our case) compete with each other in a tournament, where one team is architect of tournament (tournament host). Winner is the last team standing.
